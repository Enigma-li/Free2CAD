# Free2CAD: Parsing Freehand Drawings into CAD Commands
![](docs/teaser.png)

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of [Free2CAD](http://geometry.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/2022/free2cad/) proposed in our SIGGRAPH 2022 paper.
* **Free2CAD: Parsing Freehand Drawings into CAD Commands**<br/>
By [Changjian Li](https://enigma-li.github.io/), [Hao Pan](http://haopan.github.io/), [Adrien Bousseau](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/), [Niloy Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/),<br/>
*ACM Transaction on Graphics (TOG), 41(4), 2022.*

It contains two parts: 1) **network training**, 2) **training dataset** and **trained network deployment** (e.g., for interactive modeling).

The code is released under the **MIT license**.

### Network training
This part contains the **Python** code for building, training and testing the nueral network using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). 

ðŸ’¡ Great news: we have released the **docker file** used for training to ease the burden for configuration, please read README file within the *networkTraining* folder for more details.

### Training dataset and network deployment
This part contains the code for deploying the trained network in a C++ project that can be an interactive 3D modeling application. It also provides instructions to download the training dataset we generated, and our trained networks. 

Please read the README file in *dataAndModel* folder for more details.
